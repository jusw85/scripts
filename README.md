Collection of random scripts. They're not all well written nor robust, and some edge cases are not handled, but they suit my needs simply.

## xscreensaver-getimage-file

Prints the name of a file in a directory. Iterates through files in the directory in sequence between each invocation (case insensitive ascending), with a 2s buffer.

Used to override `xscreensaver-getimage-file` from xscreensaver which returns image files randomly.
